## Demos

Robot with the (ArUco) ID 1 is the robot that is controlled by a human player.
The robots (with IDs 10 and 12) are the "ghosts" that are controlled by the 
computer to try to catch the human controlled robot.

If the ghosts get too close to the human controlled robot, then the game is
over and can be reset so that all the robots will return to their starting
positions.

See more demos in the demo_videos folder.
